# Recipe Placeholder Image

Please save the placeholder image (the turquoise/teal background with white plate, fork, and knife) as:

```
jump-to-recipe/public/recipe-placeholder.jpg
```

This image will be automatically used for any recipe cards that don't have an image set.

The RecipeImage component has been updated to use this placeholder instead of showing a gray box with an icon.
