# 🍽️ Jump to Recipe

A modern web and mobile platform for collecting, organizing, and sharing digital cookbooks. Users can import recipes from URLs or images, create custom cookbooks, generate smart grocery lists, and collaborate with others.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (the app in jump-to-recipe/ owns its package.json and lockfile)
cd jump-to-recipe
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The root `package.json` only proxies scripts, so `npm run dev` / `npm run build` also work from the repo root
(`npm run install:app` installs from there).

> **Mac with Homebrew `vips` installed?** `sharp` will try to compile against it and fail. Install with
> `SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install` to use sharp's bundled libvips instead.
