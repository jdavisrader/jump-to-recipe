# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "My Recipes" feature introduces a dedicated personal space for logged-in users to view, search, and manage only the recipes they have created. This feature addresses the current gap where users have no way to filter and view their own uploaded recipes separately from the global recipe collection. The page will provide a familiar interface consistent with the main recipes page but filtered to show only user-created content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to access a "My Recipes" option in my account menu so I can quickly navigate to view only the recipes I have uploaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user clicks on their account dropdown THEN the system SHALL display a "My Recipes" option directly below "Your Profile"
2. WHEN a user clicks the "My Recipes" option THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/my-recipes` route
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access `/my-recipes` THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to see my recipes displayed in the same card format as the main recipes page so the interface feels consistent and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their "My Recipes" page THEN the system SHALL display recipe cards with thumbnail image, title, and tags (if any)
2. WHEN a user clicks on a recipe card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the full recipe details page
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display recipes in a responsive grid layout matching the main recipes page design
4. WHEN recipes are displayed THEN the system SHALL show only recipes created by the logged-in user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to search, sort, and filter my recipes so I can easily find specific recipes I have uploaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the "My Recipes" page THEN the system SHALL provide a search bar identical to the main recipes page
2. WHEN a user enters text in the search bar THEN the system SHALL filter recipes by title and ingredients in real-time
3. WHEN a user accesses sort options THEN the system SHALL provide the same sorting options as the main recipes page
4. WHEN no sort option is selected THEN the system SHALL default to showing most recently added recipes first
5. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state during the session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user with no uploaded recipes, I want to see an empty-state message with a clear call-to-action so I understand how to get started creating recipes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has no created recipes THEN the system SHALL display a friendly empty state message "You haven't added any recipes yet"
2. WHEN the empty state is shown THEN the system SHALL provide a prominent "Create Your First Recipe" button
3. WHEN a user clicks the "Create Your First Recipe" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the recipe creation page
4. WHEN the empty state is displayed THEN the system SHALL include an appropriate illustration or icon

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a logged-in user with many recipes, I want the page to load quickly and handle large datasets efficiently so I can browse my recipes without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has more than 20 recipes THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or infinite scroll
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL load the first batch of recipes within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a user scrolls or navigates to additional pages THEN the system SHALL load subsequent recipes without blocking the UI
4. WHEN search or filter operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide results within 1 second

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to ensure that only my own recipes are displayed so my personal recipe collection remains private and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "My Recipes" page loads THEN the system SHALL only display recipes where the current user is the creator
2. WHEN filtering recipes THEN the system SHALL exclude shared recipes where the user is only a collaborator
3. WHEN a recipe is soft-deleted by the user THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the "My Recipes" view
4. WHEN the API is called THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and validate ownership before returning recipe data
